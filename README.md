For a weather app using ReactJS that connects to a public API like OpenWeatherMap, you can display weather data in an engaging way by incorporating percentage-based information. Here's a brief overview of how you can include percentage data:

Key Features:
Humidity: Show the current humidity level as a percentage, giving users a clear idea of how much moisture is in the air.

Example: "Humidity: 75%"
Precipitation Probability: Display the chance of rain or other precipitation in percentage, helping users prepare for potential weather changes.

Example: "Chance of Rain: 60%"
Cloudiness: Indicate the cloud cover percentage to let users know how clear or overcast the sky will be.

Example: "Cloudiness: 45%"
UV Index: While usually presented as a number, consider using a percentage to show how close the current UV index is to the maximum value.

Example: "UV Exposure: 80% of the maximum safe level"
